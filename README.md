## Botanical Characterization And Geographical Origins In The Honey Market:
## A Bayesian Analysis Based On Melissopalynological Features

Aim of this work is to improve the use of melissopalynological data to discriminate geographical and botanical origin of honeys by defining statistical machine learning models for classification. Specifically, it has been chosen decision tree methods: Random Forests and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. Each of these approaches imply building multiple trees which are combined to yield a single consensus prediction (i.e., ensemble-based trees). On classification problems, each observation is assigned in a given region in the predictor space to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in that region.

***Random Forests and BART*** use trees as building blocks to define more effective prediction models. Trees approach has advantages over other methods because they are very easy to understand, to display graphically and to handle qualitative predictors avoiding the need to create dummy variables. Moreover, ensemble- based trees have an improved predictive accuracy with respect to single decision tree methods.

The expectation of defining these statistical machine learning models on melissopalynological analysis data results is to overcome limitation and difficulties of this method explained above. Further goal is to test the potential predictive capabilities and effectiveness of tree-based classification statistical models for botanical characterization and geographical origin identification.

To achieve these objectives, a dataset of pollen analysis sampling has been utilized to train various Random Forests Models built on the base of different and training predictors and parameters hypothesis. Alternatively to these models, a ***Bayesian Additive Regression Tree*** has been built on same dataset.
